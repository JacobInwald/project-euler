# Project Euler Solution Set

This repository contains solutions to the first 50 problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), written in Python. The goal is to expand these solutions to other programming languages in the future.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-euler-solutions.git
cd project-euler-solutions
```

## Usage
Each problem has its own Python script. To run a solution, use Python 3:
```bash
python3 problem1.py
```
Replace problem1.py with the script for the problem you want to solve.
